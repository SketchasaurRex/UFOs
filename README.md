# UFOs

## Overview

### Create a table to organize UFO data that will be stored as a JavaScript array. With this table, you can filter data based on certain criteria. All this created mainly through Java Script


## Results

### Using the Filtered Search on this webpage we can filter the database's data of UFO sightings.


## Summary

### There are some limitations to this page. One issue is that partial matches won't show, only exact matches. Another is that we are working with only imported data from US sightings, rendering the "Country" search pointless. Adding data from other countries will make "Country" search useful, we could add data from all around the world. Allowing partial matches to work is another change that would benefit the page.
