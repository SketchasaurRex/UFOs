# UFOs


##Overview
###Creating a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. This table will be able to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using Java Script as the main coding language.

##Results
###Using this webpage you can filter database data using the "Filter Search" section on imported data for UFO sitghtings.


##Summary
###There are some limitations to this page. One issue is that partial matches won't show, only exact matches. Another is that we are working with only imported data from US sightings, rendering the "Country" search pointless. Adding data from other countries will make "Country" search useful, we could add data from all around the world. Allowing partial matches to work is another change that would benefit the page.
